# README Generator
 This is a README.md file generator thats prompts user with questions and populates the answers into appropriate sections in a README file. 
 The purpose here is to provide the user with a template of a well structured README file which reduces the effort of writing it from scratch.

 ## User Story
 As a user i want to be able to have a means by which i do not have to type a README file everytime i create a project. This app prompts me to answer questions related to my project and populates them to my README file.

 ## Business Context

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project. A command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.
